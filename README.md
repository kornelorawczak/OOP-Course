# OOP-Course

This repository contains all the assignments I've done when attending an advanced object oriented programming course in second semester (Feb - June 2024) of Computer Science studies at 'Uniwersytet Wroc≈Çawski'. This course featured getting to know concepts of OOP in 3 programming languages: C#, Java, Ruby

I've finished this course with a group (of 2) project - [Stock Market Simulator](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/Stock-Market-Simulator), made in C++
